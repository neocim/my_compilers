<h2>Stage:</h2>

**Stopped**

My ideas was too complicated, so I decided to write something simpler before finishing this compiler: [calculator](https://github.com/neocim/my_compilers/tree/master/calculator).

<h2>Description</h2>

My first [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)-based compiler for a language whose normal name would be superfluous. To write it, I used:

- [My First Language Frontend with LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html)
- [Rust repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/) on Github
